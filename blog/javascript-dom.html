       <h1><b>JS Foundamentals</b></h1>
    
    <p>The best way I can explain JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to people is by comparing them to building a house. It all starts with HTML—this is the structure and foundation of the build. Next, we add some pizzazz to the house—maybe the color of the walls, the furniture, the decor. This is where CSS comes in, adding style and personality to the space.</p>

    <p>Control flow, is like washing your laundry. You must first gather your dirty clothes and sorting it, from the fabrics and colours. then you can load it into the washing machine. After that you'd have to choose and add the detergent then you can press start.</p>
    <br>
    <p>So DOM stands for Document.Object.Model. So what DOM entails is like a writing an interactive book for kids. You'd first start off with the title of the book, then you'd move onto the storytelling with some images to grab the kids attention, and to grab the kids attention more you can throw in a buttom that makes sounds.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The best way I can explain the difference between array and objects is that an array is to list a line of people and a an object is like a cabinet with peoples names in a folder.</p>
    <br>
    <p>A function is used when you want tell you computer everytime you see a specific name/phrase to run those step.
