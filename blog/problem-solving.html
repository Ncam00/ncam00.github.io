    <h3>Problem Solving</h3>
    <br>
  <ol>
  <li>
    <strong>Were blocked on a simple problem:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>What was the problem?</strong> Disctraction's a big factor as is may affect your learning.</li>
      <li><strong>What problem-solving techniques did you use?</strong> Praising wisely
      <li><strong>How did you feel throughout the process?</strong> That I need to keep my mind active by learning new things and not waste a single second
      <li><strong>What did you learn?</strong> To always praise yourself for little targets hit 
    </ul>
  </li>

    <li>
    <strong>We elegantly solved a problem:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>What was the problem?</strong> We needed to display a filtered list of items based on user input but our initial logic was too cluttered and slow.</li>
      <li><strong>What problem-solving techniques did you use?</strong> We broke the problem into smaller parts.</li>
      <li><strong>How did you feel throughout the process?</strong> Focused, steady, and excited—solving it cleanly felt satisfying.</li>
      <li><strong>What did you learn?</strong> That “elegant” doesn’t always mean to complex things but to make things clear, purposeful, and efficient.</li>
    </ul>
