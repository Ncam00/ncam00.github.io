    <h2>Foundations Reflections</h2>
    <ul>
  <li>
    What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the Human Skills learning?
    <p>I’ve learned that I tend to react negatively when I get caught up with tasks, that I often compare myself to others unnecessarily and that I’m capable of more empathy than I previously thought.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?
    <p>They help create collaborative environments, reduce conflict and foster growth mindsets. All of these are essential in both learning and working on coding projects.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    What has surprised you the most about the Human Skills learning?
    <p>I was surprised by how deeply it connected to real world programming teamwork. I expected soft skills to be secondary but they’re important to success.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    What were the most challenging aspects of the Human Skills learning?
    <p>Being honest with myself and opening up in group discussions was the hardest. It required vulnerability I wasn’t used to asking for help when needed.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on Human Skills learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
    <p>Because technical skills alone aren't enough — we need to communicate, collaborate and growth. Human Skills are what set great developers apart.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    Does the time you spent studying Human Skills learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.
    <p>Not at all. That time helped me become a better learner. Practising programming is important but learning how to manage emotions and work with others is also equally crucial.</p>
