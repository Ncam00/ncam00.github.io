  <h1><b>My Learning Plan</b></h1>
  <br>

  <h2>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h2>
  <p>
    My goal is to succeed in the tech industry and work at a company where I can grow and level up.
  </p>  
  <br>

  <h2>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning?</h2>
  <p>
    At this stage, there’s a lot of self-criticism. I can be hard on myself, which makes it tough to stay confident.
  </p>
  <br>  

  <h2>What skills non-technical/human skills would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h2>
  <p>
    I want to work on silencing those negative voices in my head. More self-belief and less self-doubt.
  </p>
  <br> 

  <h2>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>How will you manage yourself to work productively and safely with others?</strong><br>
      I’m still figuring this out to be honest. Right now, I’m just trying to show up, be open, and keep communication going.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>What will you do when things start building up and getting to you?</strong><br>
      Right now, I take breaks — but they sometimes drag on too long. I want to get better at taking short, intentional breaks and coming back focused.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <br>

  <h2>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h2>
  <p>
    I’ll ask for help when I need it — even if I’m stuck on something small. No more waiting till I feel overwhelmed.
  </p>
  <br>

  <h2>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h2>
  <p>
    Just to be supportive — which they already are, so shout out to them!
  </p>
  <br>

  <h2>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things?</h2>
  <p>
    Nothing major at the moment. No regular commitments that will get in the way.
